# CubCon 2019 - Rockstars Wanted: Decoding Recruiter Bullshit to Find Your Dream Job

This presentation was given at [CubCon](https://cubcon.party/) in 2019.

## Abstract

So you're ready to take the plunge and dive on in to your first InfoSec career are you?

As many of us know, Information Security is a hot industry that is always in need of talent. Recruiters will hit you up constantly trying to lure you to come work for their company. For many new people they find it flattering as recruiters heap praise on them and offer up unique challenges. 

Unfortunately many recruiters have taken a page from the real estate industry and have learned how to coach negative things as a positive and many folks new to the industry fall for it only to later find themselves in a bad situation, one that is made worse by not wanting to torpedo their emerging careers

This talk is designed to help you understand the recruiter "new speak" and how to read between the lines to find the job you *really* want.

## Additional Information
