# Seattle B-Sides 2019 - It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature

This presentation was given at the [Seattle B-Sides](https://www.bsidesseattle.com/) conference in 2019.

## Abstract

Developers are just the worst. They *hate* security, am I right?

...But, what if we were wrong about that? What if developers did care about security and us Infosec folks are actually the problem?

This talk follows my real-life experience of moving from a centralized security organization at a large company into a product development team. After being thrown into the deep end of the pool I had to learn how to incorporate security improvements and features into our product. Along the way I learned that InfoSec has been making this process much harder than it needed to be as it turns out WE are the obstinate ones.

Follow along with me as I get to the meat of the problem that causes the InfoSec vs. Development friction that seems to exist at every company and learn how I manged to fix it.

Fox Capt. very thoughtfully recorded the presentation so you can listen to the audio of it as well
